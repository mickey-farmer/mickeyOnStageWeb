# Voice assets

Place voice demo audio here (`assets/voice/`) for use on the Voice page. Suggested filenames:

- `demo-commercial.mp3` — commercial / narration
- `demo-character.mp3` — character / animation
- `demo-other.mp3` — additional demo

Wire them up in `voice.html` when ready. Add or remove demo items in the HTML to match your files.
