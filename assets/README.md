Place your media files here so the site can use them:

| File | Use |
|------|-----|
| `hero.jpg` | Hero background (full-bleed behind your name). Use your strongest headshot. |
| `about.jpg` | About section image (portrait). Can be same or different from hero. |
| `poster.jpg` | Video poster frame shown before the reel plays (optional). |
| `reel.mp4` | Your demo reel video. Copy from `../Mickey_Farmer_Reel.mp4` or use your preferred file. |
| `headshot-1.jpg` … `headshot-6.jpg` | Gallery photos. Use as many as you have; you can edit the gallery in `index.html` to add/remove slots. |

**Tips**
- Use high-quality JPEGs (e.g. 1920px wide for hero, 800–1200px for gallery).
- For `reel.mp4`, you can also host the video on Vimeo/YouTube and change the `<video>` tag in `index.html` to an iframe embed, or use a direct MP4 URL.
